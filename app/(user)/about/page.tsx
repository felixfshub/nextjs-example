          This is a Next.js application bootstrapped with
          <span className="font-mono"> create-next-app </span>, deployed on
          Vercel. It uses Auth.js for authentication, Prisma PostgreSQL as a
          database, Prisma as an ORM, and Shadcn for UI components.

        <p>
          Next.js is an open-source full-stack web development framework created
          by the private company Vercel providing React-based web applications
          with server-side rendering and static rendering.

        <p>
          React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains"
          advising it to developers when "building a server-rendered website
          with Node.js". Where traditional React apps can only render their
          content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality
          to include applications rendered on the server-side.
